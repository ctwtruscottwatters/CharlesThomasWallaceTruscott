My only answer in the NSW Supreme Court, Byron Bay Local Court or High Court of Australia, Family Court or Federal Court, or to the NSW Police is that Charles Thomas Wallace Truscott (and to the Australian Federal Police) survived mind control programming and mind control experimentation from the Australian security and intelligence organisations, as was known to most White House staff, the IGIS, the Intelligence Ombudsman of America, and in any lifetime court case I only make allegations against David Taylor Irvine or Nicholas Peter Warner. My message to Reece Kershaw, the Premier of NSW, the NSW Police Commissioner. Sir Alex Younger and Richard and Margaret Moore also have records on Charles Truscott and his allegations against security and intelligence services of mind control experimentation and brainwashing procedures. In the NSW Police interview I say I survived mind control programming, with mind control triggers such as repetitive phrases, number sequences, nursery rhymes, and blame David Irvine and Nick Warner, the former Chiefs of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. supremecourt.nsw.gov.au
